# Order form

[Demo](https://vladk96.github.io/order-form/)

This is a home-work of kottans course.

In this home task I created order form from [mockup](https://dribbble.com/shots/1322677-Checkout-Page/attachments/186093) using HTML5 semantic elements.
This form has validation which implemented with native HTML validation without JS. Also the form is adaptive to different screens.
